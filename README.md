# 📝 Automatic English Grammar Correction

## 📌 Overview  
This project offers an AI-powered solution for automatically correcting grammar mistakes in English sentences. It helps users improve their writing by providing grammatically correct alternatives in real-time.

## 🚀 Features  
- Instantly corrects common grammar mistakes  
- User-friendly and quick to use  
- Ideal for students, writers, content creators, and language learners  
- Powered by state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** – for implementing the logic and model integration  
- **Hugging Face Transformers** – to load and use powerful pre-trained language models  
- **T5-based Model (prithivida/grammar_error_correcter_v1)** – fine-tuned specifically for English grammar correction  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – ideal environments for testing and running the code interactively  

## 💡 How It Works  
This project uses a pre-trained **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** model that is specialized in grammar correction tasks. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. A user inputs an English sentence that may contain grammar mistakes.  
2. The model receives the sentence with a prefix: `"correct grammar:"` which tells it the intended task.  
3. The model processes the input using deep learning techniques and generates a grammatically correct version of the sentence.  
4. The corrected sentence is then returned to the user.

Thanks to the power of transfer learning, the model can understand and fix a wide variety of grammar errors without needing any extra training.

## 🎯 Example  
**Input:** `He go to school everyday.`  
**Output:** `He goes to school every day.`  

## 🧠 Use Cases  
- Assisting with homework or assignments  
- Enhancing content quality for blogs or social media  
- Helping non-native speakers write better English  
- Building smarter educational or writing assistant tools
